# ðŸ‘¤ Customers-Management

This is my repository where I store my Customer Management project, I created it to create knowledge in Python, flask, Peewee, bootstrap, HTML, Jinja, among others.

Watching the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39zbyHjgjrbsP3xFSc-YH-6FN8WNpglh) and using [iazzetta's](https://github.com/Iazzetta/) LIB [cru.js](https://github.com/Iazzetta/cru.js) to help teach how to create this project, everything was easier, I made some changes to make the page a little prettier and also make it more dynamic.

That's why I'm giving him credit.
