# ðŸ‘¤ Customer Management

In this repository, I put my customer management project, I created it based on the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL39zbyHjgjrbsP3xFSc-YH-6FN8WNpglh) and with the LIB [cru.js](https://github.com/Iazzetta/cru.js) of [Programador Python](https://www.youtube.com/@programadorpython), I recommend that you use it if you want to create a well-structured website, I'm leaving the credits because it helped me learn a lot more python, html, even bootstrap, greatly improving my programming logic, among others...

I made changes to make the page more dynamic and even more beautiful for a better user experience.
